contents: At the beginning of the first "Mysterious Philosopher's Stone", Harry looked at the snake in the glass and found that he could understand the snake's speech because the family was going to the zoo for his cousin Dali's birthday. This picture is super classic, and it also paved the way for Harry to understand crawling and talking. The scene was shot in the History of the Reptile House, the amphibian museum in London Zoo.
