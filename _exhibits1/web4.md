contents: King's Cross railway station, is a passenger railway terminus in the Camden, which is on the edge of Central London.In the Harry Potter films, King's Cross Station appears in every one of them, with Platform 9 and 3/4 (entered through the brick wall barrier between platforms 9 and 10) being the wizards' entrance to Hogwarts.In fact, the real location for the filming was not between platforms 9 and 10. This is because platforms 9 and 10 are in a separate building from the main station and are separated by two intermediate tracks. The real pick-up point is located between platforms 4 and 5.In 1999, a replica of the 9 and 3/4 station plaque was erected on the platform with the half-entered suitcase underneath, and in 2012, the Harry Potter shop was opened and the plaque was relocated, making it a popular attraction for fans and tourists alike.
