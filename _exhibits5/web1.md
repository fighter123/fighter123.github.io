contents: The Millennium Bridge is to celebrate the empty bridge built in front of St. Paul's Cathedral in 2000. It is full of modernity and can only be walked by pedestrians. Both sides of the bridge span the River Thames. From St. Paul's Cathedral to the other side of the bridge, it will meet Thames. Tate Modern, a special art museum, just cleverly connects the gathering point of ancient religion and modern art.
