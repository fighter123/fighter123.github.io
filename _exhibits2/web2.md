contents: Lambeth Bridge spans the River Thames and connects Lambeth to Westminster.In "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", Harry ran away from his aunt's house and was homeless. At that time, he came across a knight bus. In the film, the Knight Bus and two Muggle buses faced each other on a bridge. When Harry screamed out of fear, the Knight Bus suddenly narrowed and then managed to pass through the two Muggle buses.The bridge in the film clip is Lambeth Bridge, which spans the River Thames and connects Lambeth to Westminster. Lambeth Bridge is adjacent to Westminster Bridge, which is located downstream of it. Lambeth Bridge is dominated by red, the same color as the leather benches in the House of Lords at the Palace of Westminster. Westminster Bridge, on the other hand, is predominantly green, the same color as the leather benches in the House of Commons at the Palace of Westminster. Standing on Lambeth Bridge, you can see the famous British attractions Big Ben and the London Eye.
