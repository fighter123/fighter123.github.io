contents: Great Scotland Yard is a street in Westminster, London
In "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" , when Harry and Mr. Weasley went to a hearing for using magic in front of Muggles, they entered the Ministry of Magic through a red telephone booth here. In "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", Weasley also took Harry through here to enter the Ministry of Magic and attend disciplinary hearings.The point of entry into the Ministry of Magic is at the junction of Scotland Square and Great Scotland Yard. Unfortunately, the red telephone booth is only a filming prop. If visitors come to sightseeing, they will not see the red telephone booth.
